SVG Path Sampler & Mapper

This project provides tools to parse, sample, and visualize SVG path data by converting SVG path strings (d attributes) into a set of dense (x, y, z) points suitable for visualization or further processing. It supports Bézier curves, arcs, lines, and more, and includes tools to extract and sample paths from SVG files.
Features

    Parses SVG path (d attribute) into structured data.
    Samples paths to generate dense (x, y, z) point sets.
    Supports Bézier curves, arcs, and line segments.
    Provides a visualization tool using Matplotlib.
    Extracts SVG commands (rectangles, circles, ellipses, lines, and paths).
    Generates a structured output file with sampled coordinates.
